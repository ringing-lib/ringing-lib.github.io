<h3>Read the manual</h3>

<p>This is the manual for the Ringing Class Library, version 0.3.0.
It is not automatically kept up to date, but should always be fairly
recent.  The most recent version of the manual can be <a
href="index.php?page=download.html">downloaded</a> 
from SourceForge.</p>

<p>You can get the manual in several formats:
<ul>
<li><a href="manual/index.html">HTML (one file per node)</a></li>
<li><a href="ringing-lib.html">HTML (single file)</a></li>
<li><a href="ringing-lib.pdf">PDF</a></li>
</ul>
The manual is under development at the same time as the library, 
so parts are not totally finished.</p>

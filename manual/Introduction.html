The Ringing Class Library is a collection of C++ classes which implement
various concepts found in change ringing, and make it possible to
implement programs which use these concepts without having to write the
basic algorithms over and over again.

   <p>The library is split into several sections:
     <ul>
<li>Classes for dealing with individual rows and changes, and how the
interact with each other;

     <li>Classes for building and manipulating methods;

     <li>Classes for accessing method libraries;

     <li>Classes for proving and analysing sequences of rows;

     <li>Classes for producing printed output. 
</ul>

   <p>Thus it is possible to use whatever part of the library is necessary for
your program; for example, a method editing program would use the method
classes, whereas a program to simulate call changes would just use the
row and change classes.

   <p>There are also several utilities included with the library.  These
demonstrate how to use the Ringing Class Library in your own programs,
and are useful in their own right.  Currently included are
<span class="command">gsiril</span>, a peal proving program with an interface similar to
the popular MicroSIRIL program; <span class="command">psline</span>, a utility to print
lines for methods in <acronym>PDF</acronym> or PostScript; and
<span class="command">methsearch</span>, a program which searches for methods satisfying
various given criteria.  These utilities may be found in the <span class="file">apps</span>
subdirectory.

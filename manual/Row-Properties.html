<h3 class="section">3.2 Row properties</h3>

<p><a name="index-row-properties-11"></a>
There are several properties of rows which arise from group theory and
can be useful in looking at properties of methods.

   <p><a name="index-order-12"></a>The <dfn>order</dfn> of a row is the number of times which that row has to be
multiplied by itself before it gets back to rounds. For example, the row
<span class="samp">21436587</span> has order 2, because if it is multiplied by itself
twice, you get back to rounds. Similarly the row <span class="samp">23145678</span> has
order 3, and the row <span class="samp">23456781</span> has order 8. This can be useful,
for example, in seeing how many leads of a method are needed in a plain
course before it comes round.

   <p><a name="index-sign-13"></a><a name="index-parity-14"></a>Another useful concept is the <dfn>sign</dfn> or <dfn>parity</dfn> of a row. A row
is considered <dfn>even</dfn> if it takes an even number of swaps of pairs of
bells to get from rounds to that row, and <dfn>odd</dfn> if it takes an odd
number of swaps. (It can be shown that whether the number is odd or even
doesn't depend on exactly what the sequence of swaps is).

   <p><a name="index-cycles-15"></a>Finally, every row can be expressed as a set of <dfn>cycles</dfn>. A cycle is
a set of bells which move round in a sequential way as the row is
repeated; for example, <span class="samp">21345678</span> has only one cycle, which is
<span class="samp">(12)</span>; and <span class="samp">12356478</span> has one cycle, which is
<span class="samp">(456)</span>. Combining these two cycles will give us the row <span class="samp">213564678</span>.

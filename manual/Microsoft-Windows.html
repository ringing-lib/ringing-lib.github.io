<h3 class="section">2.4 Microsoft Windows</h3>

<p>When compiling on Microsoft Windows, the range of different compilers and
lack of a standard powerful scripting language make it difficult to
provide a genuinely portable infrastructure to the package.  However, the
task of compiling and installing the library is not complicated, and easy
to achieve by hand.  The following steps are necessary:
     <ul>
<li>Create the file <span class="file">ringing/common-ac.h</span> by editing
<span class="file">common-ac.h.in</span> to reflect the characteristics of your C++ compiler;

     <li>Compile all the <span class="file">.cpp</span> source files in the <span class="file">ringing</span>
subdirectory into a library, which you will probably want to call
<span class="file">ringing.lib</span>;

     <li>Install the compiled library and the header files in places where
your compiler and linker will be able to find them;

     <li>Optionally, install and run the tests in the <span class="file">tests</span>
subdirectory.

     <li>Copy the documentation to somewhere permanent.

     <li>If desired, compile and install the utilities in the <span class="file">apps</span>
subdirectory. 
</ul>

   <p>Note that the header files are designed to be included from a
subdirectory called <span class="file">ringing</span> within your system's collection of
header files.

   <p>If you wish to compile only the part of the library which is licensed
for use in commercial programs, make sure you only compile and link
those files which explicitly state that they are under the Lesser GNU
Public License <acronym>LGPL</acronym>.  See <a href="Licensing.html#Licensing">Licensing</a>.

   <p>If you are using Microsoft Developer Studio, then you can use the
supplied workspace file <span class="file">ringing-lib.dsw</span> to accomplish the
compiling and linking of the library without any effort.  In addition,
with the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler you do not need to edit
<span class="file">ringing/common-ac.h</span> by hand: there is a ready-customised version,
called <span class="file">common-msvc.h</span>, which will be found and used automatically.

   <p>Currently the class library should normally be compiled into a static
library (<span class="file">.lib</span> file).  It is not yet straightforward to make the
library into a DLL; if you choose to do this, you are on your own but
the authors would be please to hear of any success.

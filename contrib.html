<h3>Contributing to the Ringing Class Library</h3> 

<p>If you think the Ringing Class Library is a good idea and would
like to contribute to its development, you are very welcome to help.
You will need to get an ID on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> and then visit the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ringing-lib">project page</a>,
which contains links to all sorts of information related to the
project.  If you email a project administrator, they'll add you to the
list of developers and you will then be able to get at and change the
source code.</p>

<p>If you don't want to get involved with developing the library, but
would like to report a bug or make a suggestion for future
developments, please visit the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ringing-lib">project page</a>
where you can access various forums and submit bugs.</p>
